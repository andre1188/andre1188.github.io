Favorites 120L Labs

Lab 1-

This was one of my favorite labs because it was the start of development of my programming skills. It was something new to me and I was ready to take on this challenge. It was the beginning of something new for me that would help me in the future.

Lab 10- 

This was one of my favorite labs as well because this lab was done independently. It was sort of a challenge not having a partner to work with like we usually did but overall I liked the experience. It put my programming skills to the test.

Lab 12-

This is was probably my favorite lab because in a way it was a reflection of my work from the entire semester. It showed me how far I came since the beginning of the semester to now. It also showed me how great it was taking this course.
